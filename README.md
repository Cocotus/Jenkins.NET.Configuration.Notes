# Installation of Jenkins (for Microsoft Builds (.NETCore/NETFramework/Xamarin/NETStandard..)
Following instructions describe setup of a Jenkins configuration which is used too automate builds of Microsoft Visual Studio projects.
It's recommended to create Nuget packages instead of simple dll files as build output of your visual studio class projects and host those nuget packages in your own nuget server and uses that server in your projects. 

Furthermore this tutorial will tell you how to achieve following for each job in Jenkins:

- Display of warnings graph, test results graph, codecoverage graph, detailed HTML report of codecodeverage
- Trigger release build of project, create nuget package and push that to your own nuget server

# Jenkins Continuous Integration Flow



Source Code Management:

- Specify Git repository URL and credentials to fetch code

- Specify branches to build



Build Triggers:

- Specify GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling



Build Environment:

- Delete workspace before build starts



Build Actions:

- Use NuGet to restore packages before build operation

- Build Visual Studio project solution using MSBuild

- Start to run NUnit unit tests and execute code coverage with OpenCover

- Convert OpenCover XML report into Cobertura XML report using OpenCoverToCoberturaConverter



Post-Build Actions:

- Convert NUnit XML report into a readable HTML page

- Convert OpenCover XML report into readable HTML pages using ReportGenerator

- Scan MSBuild compiler log for warnings and publish report to Jenkins

- Publish NUnit test result report to Jenkins job build

- Publish converted Cobertura code coverage report to Jenkins job build

- Publish generated HTML report pages  to Jenkins job build

- Send build notifications to Slack channel
